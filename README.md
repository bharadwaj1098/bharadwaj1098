### Hi, I'm Sai Bharadwaj Reddy(I go by Sai) ðŸ‘‹

I am an MSc in Computer Science with specialization in the field of AI and Robotics. I believe in being a jack of all trades but, sill better than master of one and this allows me to have freedom to explore the fields, build projects as I go. A true nerdy engineer by heart :)

  <br>
  I'm Skilled in Python, Pytorch, Sql and NoSql databases, Javascript ðŸ™‚
  
  
  
  Fun Fact:- I would like to go to Mars :P
